# Django

## What is it?

- A Python web framework
- Creates websites with Python
- Not for front-end, but back-end
- "PHP but cooler"

## To Install

- `pip install django`
- May take a bit

## Creating a project

- `django-admin startproject <project_name>`
- That creates a project directory named `<project_name>` with various python files for django

```
project_name/ #renamable
    project_name/ #not-renamable
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    manage.py
```

- `manage.py`
  - Do not edit this file
  - Used to manage the website
    - Access database, create users, etc.

- `__init__.py`
  - Just for python to view that directory as a *python package*

- `settings.py`
  - Various settings for the website

- `urls.py`
  - "Table of contents" for the website

## Django webserver

- All django installations come with a webserver
- Not necessarily meant for production

### To start up the webserver

- `python manage.py runserver`

## Django Apps

- A part of the website, it does **one** thing

### To create an app

- `python manage.py startapp <app_name>`
- Creates a new directory within your project directory

```
project_name/ #renamable
    app_name/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
    project_name/ #not-renamable
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    manage.py
```

- `migrations/`
  - A migration is a way to hook up your source code with a database
- `admin.py`
  - Gives the website admin functionality to edit database, add/delete users, etc.
- `apps.py`
  - Configuration file for the specific app
- `models.py`
  - A model is a blueprint for the database
- `tests.py`
  - For automated testing
- `views.py`
  - Views are functions that take a user request and returns something, most often a web page

## Views

- When a user sends a request to the website, the url is sent to the `urls.py` file. 

```python
...
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
...
```

- So when we go to `website.com/admin` it'll reference the url in this line of `urls.py` to figure out what to do/return
- `admin.site.urls` is how we want to respond
- In the `urls.py`:

```

```

- In the `views.py`:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HTTPResponse("<h1>This is a webpage</h1>")

```
